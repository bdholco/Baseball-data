    "Analyzing Pareto's Law and Price's Law using two different types of productivity data which will be defined as 'intellectual' and 'physical' :\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Pareto's Law:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pareto's Law is the famous '80/20' rule. Which is to say that about 20% of producers in a given domain will produce 80% of the overall results. The economist Vilfredo Pareto formulated it by checking tax records and finding that 20% of the people produced (or accumulated) 80% of the income in a town. So for example, if a town hjas 100 residents and produced 1,000 dollars of income then 20 of those residents will have 800 dollars of the towns income. \n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Price's Law:\n",
    "\n",
    "Price's law is similar to Parreto's law in that it is an attempt to describe how certain productive qualities can scale. It was formulated by Derek J. de Solla Price who analyzed academic publications and found that the square root of producers of published scholarly papers produced half of all publications. So for example, if 100 professors published 1000 papers then 10 of those professors will have published 500 of the total papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do these power laws of highly productive people work across different types of production? \n",
    "\n",
    "The different types of production:\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical: meaning something that has to be done physically by a persInteeon everytime the production happens. So for example, if i gave 100 people shovels and asked them to dig up 1000 acres of land would 20 of those people dig up 800 acres or would 10 of those people dig up 500 acres? Since the process of digging with shovels requires that every acre be dug individual again and again would one of the power laws apply to pysical porduction like that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Intellectual: meaning an intangible product that does not require physically producing the work over an over again. So for example, a piece of software like an app in an app store, once completed, it can be purchased over and over again without any extra physical production to produce it. Books, recorded music, movies and other forms of enterainment are examples of an intellectual product that can be sold endlessly despite only needing to be produced once. "

    "How do MLB baseball stats fit into power laws?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using babseball stats because of the availablity of the statistics and I think professional sports leagues may prove to be a good combination of physical and intellectual production. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is pysical production in sports because actually playing the games requires the player to show up and put in physical work. Also, because the rules are clearly defined and every team, in theory, has the same end goal of winning the league championship this hopefully removes the subjective element of analyzing productivity data as the quality of a product (as opposed to the quantity) is a difficult, inherently subjective measure to come up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is intellectual production in sports because payment for individual players can be based on things other than just physical production. Teams need to draw in fans with big name players whose fame can be based on intangible personal charcteristics or even advertising endorsements outside of the sport itself.\n",

    "It appears that power laws may apply as good rules of thumb but would need to to altered in their original form. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does appear that the group of players that would fall into the Pareto distribution group (top 20%) are much more productive than the average player. The same goes for the even smaller group that would fall into the Price's law group but not nearly to the extent that might be predicted by the original formulation of Price's law. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis that the \"intellectual\" aspect of the game would be more subject to a power law seems to only have some validity. It might be true that the very top players get paid something like 10% more than their production on the field might suggest, salaries do not scale and produce similar results to intellectual products like software.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible explanation is that the the contracts the league has with the players union prevent truly runaway salaries for the very top players (things like having a salary cap for example) If player salaries were operatiung in more of a free market there might be more money going to the very top players. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps professional sports players were not the best group to judge the \"intellectual\" products on. Their salary is still dependent on factors outside their control as well as physical production. Ichiro, for example, was the most physically productive hitter in 2004 but his salary did not qualify him for being in the Price's law group. Since these contracts are signed for years at a time choosing any one year as a snapshot may not be representatiove of longterm trends (especially for individual players)"
